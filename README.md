# Twitter fake account finder

Fake accounts are created in social networking websites to artificially inflate the number of followers of a person. This is harmful as it can make accounts look trustworthy and can be used to attract genuine followers. Such accounts are also used to spread disinformation and make certain topics trend. Through this project, we have built a classifiers for finding fake Twitter accounts. We want to create a feature set which incorporates the semantic meaning of a personâ€™s tweets (in addition to profile features) for this classification task.
